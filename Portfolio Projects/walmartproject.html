                    This project focuses on analyzing Walmart sales data to identify the top-performing branches and products, understand sales trends for different products, and study customer behavior. The primary goal is to explore how sales strategies can be optimized and improved.
                    The dataset was sourced from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting">Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.</a> <br>
                    The competition involved providing historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across various regions.

                        Gross Profit = Total Sales - COGS <br>

                    <p>
                        Unit Price = 45.79 <br>
                        Quantity = 7 <br>
                        COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 <br>
                        VAT = 5% of 320.53 = 16.03 <br>
                        Total Sales = 320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56 <br>
                        Gross Margin = (Gross Income / Total Sales) = 4.76%
