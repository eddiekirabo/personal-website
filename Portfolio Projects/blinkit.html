                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Blinkit, formerly known as Grofers, is an Indian online grocery delivery service. Founded in 2013 by Albinder Dhindsa and Saurabh Kumar, the company initially focused on providing a wide range of grocery products, household essentials, and other daily-use items to customers' doorsteps. <br>
                    Blinkit follows a B2C (Business to Consumer) model, partnering with various suppliers, brands, and local vendors.
                    It operates with a focus on high customer density areas, utilizing a vast network of delivery agents. <br>
                    The fictitious data for this project was obtained from an online data sample resorce and is in no way shape or form a reflection of the actual company.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    To extrat the data from the zip file, import it into an excel document, clean it and prepare the data using proper data cleaning practices. After that, I imported the data into PowerBi and created a dashboard visualization to summarize the data and provide insights on the perfomance of the 
                    dispatch locations, percentage of fat content ordered by store and the perfomance of stores according to the outlet establishment, location, size and type.
